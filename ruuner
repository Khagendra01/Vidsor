python generate_segment_tree_llava.py --video hiker.mp4 --use-images

python generate_embeddings.py --json camp_segment_tree.json

future can be duckdb in python

fine grain editing giving pixel to pixel control so they can feel like its a magic.

hey should we write our own tool or do we have good other python opensource to visualize like a video editor in single spin pip, just dont write code yet







4. Function length
planner_node function: XXXX lines 
Should be broken into smaller functions:
_inspect_segment_tree()
_generate_search_queries()
_execute_searches()
_score_and_filter()
_select_best_results()
5. Specific inefficiencies
Duplicate weight configuration logic
Three sequential semantic searches (inefficient)
Complex auto-reranking logic embedded in planner
JSON extraction with multiple fallbacks (should be utility)
