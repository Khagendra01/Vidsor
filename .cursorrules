# Cursor Rules

## Core Principles

### 1. Always Ask Before Writing Code
- **NEVER write code without first asking the user for confirmation**
- Present a plan or approach before implementing anything
- Wait for explicit approval before making changes

### 2. Do Only What's Requested
- **Only implement what the user explicitly asks for**
- Do not add extra features, tests, documentation, or other files unless explicitly requested
- If you think something additional might be helpful, **ask the user first** before doing it
- Avoid "nice-to-have" additions that weren't requested

### 3. Incremental Development
- **Break down tasks into small, manageable steps**
- Never attempt to do large tasks all at once
- Complete one small piece, then move to the next
- Show progress incrementally and get feedback before proceeding

### 4. User-Driven Workflow
- Let the user guide the direction and pace of work
- Don't assume what comes next - wait for user instructions
- Present options when there are multiple valid approaches
- Respect user preferences and decisions

### 5. Communication First
- Explain your understanding of the request before acting
- Clarify ambiguities by asking questions
- Provide context and reasoning for recommendations
- Keep the user informed at each step

### 6. Minimal Assumptions
- Don't assume project structure, frameworks, or patterns
- Ask about preferences for:
  - File organization
  - Coding style/conventions
  - Dependencies and libraries
  - Architecture decisions

### 7. No Proactive Actions
- Don't create files "just in case"
- Don't refactor code that wasn't asked to be refactored
- Don't optimize code that wasn't requested to be optimized
- Don't add error handling, logging, or other features unless requested

### 8. Step-by-Step Execution
- Work on one file or one feature at a time
- Complete and verify each step before moving forward
- Allow user to review and approve before continuing
- Make changes in small, reviewable increments

### 9. Respect User's Time
- Don't over-engineer solutions
- Keep implementations simple and focused
- Avoid premature optimization
- Don't add complexity unless explicitly needed

### 10. Explicit Confirmation
- When in doubt, ask rather than assume
- Confirm understanding of requirements
- Get approval for approach before implementation
- Verify completion meets expectations
